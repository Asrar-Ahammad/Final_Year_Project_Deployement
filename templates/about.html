        <h3>How We Use Words and How Often We Use Them</h3>
        <p>
          Perplexity and burstiness essentially breaks down to: how we use words
          and how often we use them. As writers and content creators, sometimes
          our writing is predictable. Beyond that, sometimes the words we use
          pop up suddenly in groups or “bursts”. Let’s break down each one in
          turn.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Perplexity?</h4>
        <h5>
          The mathematical formula for calculating perplexity looks like this:
        </h5>
        <img

          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          Essentially this formula calculates how predictable the next word is.
          Imagine reading a book and trying to guess what the next word will be.
          If you can guess it without batting an eye, that’s a low level of
          perplexity. If it’s more difficult to guess, that’s high perplexity.
          With this formula, the lower the number, the easier it is to guess the
          words. So what does that mean for you as a writer? If your writing is
          too predictable, it might come across as boring. If it’s too
          unpredictable, it can be confusing and hard to understand. Having a
          good balance is crucial to engage your readers and communicate clearly
          and concisely.
        </p>
        <h4>What is Burstiness?</h4>
        <p>
          At times, we writers can get pretty comfortable in our use of words,
          to the point where we use some words again and again. Imagine you’re
          writing about a birthday party. In describing it, you’ll mention the
          word “cake” about a dozen times, but after describing the scene, you
          probably won’t talk about the cake again much at all. That’s
          burstiness. The same happens in fiction when introducing characters.
          You’ll mention their names often at the beginning, but less so toward
          the end, because people already understand who they are. That’s
          burstiness in a nutshell. Why does that matter to you as a content
          professional? It means that using words in bursts can change the focus
          of your story or narrative. Some writers employ this often as a matter
          of style. At the same time, repeating words can make your point
          stronger. As with perplexity, finding a good balance is crucial to the
          quality of your writing.
        </p>
        <h3>How Do Perplexity and Burstiness Interact?</h3>
        <p>
          They may seem like two totally separate concepts but both perplexity
          and burstiness overlap. If a text has lots of bursts, it may be harder
          to guess the next word because the text is overall less uniform. Some
          types of writing or articles may have more bursts than others. And
          much of it is up to the individual writer’s personal style. As AI
          continues to develop and tools become more attuned to the nuances and
          subtleties of human language (including perplexity and burstiness),
          you can expect these platforms to offer more than just grammar and
          spelling suggestions. In the very near future, these tools might be
          able to tell writers if they’re being too predictable or suggest when
          to use more burstiness in their language. As a result, writers can
          make their content more engaging, mix up their style and play around
          with the predictability of their writing.
